# NeuralNetwork
A neural network, for fun mostly.

**BEFORE REFERENCING THIS CODE:** This is pretty much entirely my own interpretation of how a Neural Network system should work, based on my understanding of how they work. None of this code should be assumed to be correct, properly implemented, or optimal. However, there is nothing wrong with a new outlook or approach to a problem. Maybe I'll stumble upon something great. Currently, that probably isn't the case. This note will probably not be here when it is the case.

It's currently set up to learn the difference between number sets with repeating numbers and ones without.
